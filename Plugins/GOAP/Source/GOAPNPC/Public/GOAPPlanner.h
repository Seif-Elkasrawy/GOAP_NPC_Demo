  * currentWorld into a state satisfying goal, using backward-chaining A*
  * search: nodes represent a shrinking subgoal (what still needs to become
  * true), and edges represent actions that can satisfy part of that subgoal.
  * Precomputes an effect index and a cheapest-cost-per-atom index from its
  * action set once, so that both candidate lookup (getAdjacent) and the
  * search heuristic (computeHeuristic) avoid scanning every registered
  * action on every node expansion.
