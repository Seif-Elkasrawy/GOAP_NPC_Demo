 /**
  * The state of the world (the "logic world" GOAP reasons over) is made up of atoms.
  * An atom is a predicate (a simple string name) paired with a boolean truth value.
  * GOAPWorldState exists to give the planner, actions, and world-state comparisons
  * (satisfaction checks, effect application) a single, uniform representation to
  * operate on, independent of how any individual atom is produced or consumed.
